# Image-Clustering

This code partitions the image into clusters to segment the image parts by using an implementation of k-means clustering algorithm. An example image is given. After defining the cluster number and maximum number of iterations for k-means algorithm, image segmentation process starts. Image pixels are clustered and each pixel is assigned related cluster color. Final image is showed.
